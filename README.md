# MONOGON REVISION 7
```
To whom it may concern...

Hello github user!
This sorry excuse of a "Game Engine" is being "worked on" by two lazy developers who RARELY get things working properly.
This is under the MIT license so if you're desperate enough to need to learn from our code (please reconsider) you may do so.
THAT BEING SAID, this is just the "public" build, many classes are being withheld in a private repo.
Don't expect this to build for QUITE a while.
Furthermore, this is the 7th time we've both decided to rebuild the engine from the ground up, probably not the last time either.
```
